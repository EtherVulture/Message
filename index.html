<p>Some gnostic stuff I learned... demiurge is a&nbsp; "secondary god" because the prime creator highest god cannot materialize, so the demiurge is an agent for creation. Also defined as "architect" if you heard of his name as "the one who created the matrix." Never saw the matrix movie myself since I was too young when everyone watched it... <br /><br />There are people who view it like the demiurge is an evil enslaver. Satan. Machine, soul-trap, prison-planet, simulation, whatever. My theorizing is still in progress and this is what I thought of so far... I do not agree with those who want to "flee away from the light" when there's supposed light approaching after death and you have a choice to enter it, they're afraid that going to the light gets your soul harvested by the malevolent demiurge... because of some Saturn cults, and they usually dislike their own life. <br /><br />Oh and by the way terms like "satan" come into existence as a new separate thing just because humans believe in it, "egregore" you can search that term up if not familiar already. Not to say that there aren't more powerful sentient souls in the spiritual dimension, or that there aren't influences from Saturn. It appears to me as if satan translated as "adversary" is the same creative force that helps people when they pray to any good "god", so it depends on us and our beliefs what this demiurge is doing. Similarly archons and archangels are same thing that can do both good or evil.&nbsp; <br /><br />And between death and rebirth most of us probably willingly choose to reincarnate. I remember starting to study Rudolf Steiner's "life between death and rebirth", a lot did not make sense to me. He also apparently described an "ahriman" that some people label as satan, as the force that promotes deadening of everything, and artificial intelligence would be part of the soullessness... which again to me sounds like it contrasts with the "prison-planet" viewpoint.&nbsp;<br /><br />What are prayers really? Why do they work (unbelievably well sometimes)? I think remote viewing can help explain one theory.. as Jesus also told people to believe in their healing first before they saw evidence of any healing, in order for it to occur. Just as the placebo effect where faith is necessary. Some bizarre hypnosis experiments proved the power of faith. I remember your story too of your sister being cured of what was diagnosed as impossible to cure. <br /><br />Since some see demiurge as synonymous for satan.... Christian's say "we live in a satan's world" (and Saturn, chronos, chronology, time on physical domain make more sense that way too, it's not pure evil but necessary aspect in order for physicality to exist), we have to redefine satan.</p>
<p>One time the biblical god commands to kill children which was not meant as any sort of metaphorical psalm but it actually caused religious wars, historical events... and then god says do not kill... (for various reasons, it must be the demiurge spoken of in the bible). Which means biblical god and the so-hated demiurge-satan are one. Neither good nor bad. Creates good and evil.</p>
<p>As Isaiah 45.7 states. I actually remember seeing numerous people talk about god and satan being one and the same but I was very confused until now. I remember asking a powerful satanic witch online, they answered "no, biblical yahweh and satan are not the same." I guess there are just so many varying perspectives even in the occult world.</p>
<p><br />And we also have a spiritual side to us, hence we too are demiurge in a way, we are creators. The bible implies many times that "kingdom of heaven is within you". <br /><br />Bible speaks of God in plural form which was likely meant to be interpreted in various ways on different occasions, sometimes that every single one of us has divinity within. <br /><br />All Christians know "Belief alone saves you..." belief in what? <br /><br />Quoting a religious bible thumper website: "Joel chapter 3 talks about God's future judgment of the nations. It is in that context that we see the command {l<strong>et</strong>&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>weak</strong>&nbsp;<strong>say</strong>,&nbsp;'<strong>I</strong>&nbsp;<strong>am</strong>&nbsp;<strong>strong'}."</strong> <br /><br /><strong>So the belief we need in order to be saved is.. in the inner planes, the imaginary power + faith. It takes mind power and desire, and that's what very powerful influential occultists believed in. In more common terminology that would be: spirit doesn't understand language, only feelings, thus prayers don't work without inducing a feeling faith.</strong> <br /><br />This is where new thought teachers, those like Neville Goddard make some sense of the bible, interpreting the flood as the world drowning us with seemingly real facts, but by going within and rearranging your beliefs you will survive it... the story of Jacob and blindly touching, then give the blessing to that which FEELS right even though it wasn't the original plan... this is same stuff as all the "psalm magick" is about, practiced by actual witches.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />I remember some years ago before covid I started digging spiritual but not religious beliefs. That's like Alan Watts and such. All is one. All is god. It makes sense logically that the substance which makes up all existence has got to be the exact same substance everywhere. Therefore all in existence is an expression of God. For the same reason all information is accessible at any point in space.</p>
<p><br />However, the religious ignorant farts would be like "no, the bible forbids the worship of creation... you gotta worship the creator... and thereby hate the creation and battle against evil in this world..." whenever philosophical discussions lead to everything in existence being an expression of god.<br /><br />Which circles back to the aforementioned interpretation of the bible, that in truth<strong>, circumstances around us is the creation</strong> we have to turn away from, <strong>stop believing in creation.</strong> <br /><br />And go within, into "imagination" which is actually the higher planes (such as astral). These higher planes are the cause of circumstances in physical world. The <strong>creator within</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />In other words, when bible speaks of turning away from material world, it means stop acting like a victim of creations, and embrace the creator within you.</p>
<p>With magic spellsz witches cast spells by feeling like the work is already accomplished. And by the way witchcraft spells work by natural means. They manipulate circumstances in seemingly undetectable ways. Not necessarily like laws of physics get defied with every spell. Remember the Hitler's supernatural rise to power video?&nbsp;<a title="Hitler's Supernatural Rise to Power? | National Geographic" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y6H1_wiQsg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y6H1_wiQsg</a><br /><br />Another contradiction proving that this is how the bible is meant to be taken, is:<em> "we wrestle not against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness</em>". - <strong>doesn't the entire religion depend on people wrestling with material desires</strong>? Every sunday I remember the repetition that human nature is evil... obviously that is not what occultists would mean to say in their circles when they wrote the bible. <br /><br />The way to integrate all these scriptures to make sense without contractions is the same kabbalistic, magical interpretation: Doubts and fears are prayers for evil to happen.<br /><br />Once again, I did NOT hear words, nor see spelled out words, about what I remote viewed either in sessions with you or with practice.</p>
<p>Similarly when information flows the opposite direction during true prayers.</p>
<p>God of this world, aka demiurge, does not receive words when we pray but sort telepathic feelings.</p>
<p>Just like we do not receive words during remote viewing. We receive feelings!!!</p>
<p>And then there's always interpreting of the feelings, and I'm glad I did not tell you "there's a cardboard card" (when thinking of the tray under candle jars..) I received th feeling, then pictured as best I could using objects from recent memory, which was a flat cardboard card...&nbsp;<br /><br />Another way to view it if the only reason you read is because you're convinced remote viewing is real but all else spiritual is BS - Placebo is effect undoubtedly recognized and accepted by mainstream science worldwide. What is the barrier beyond which the placebo effect cannot extend, if we now know that the mind can retrieve information from across the world?&nbsp;<br /><!--/data/user/0/com.samsung.android.app.notes/files/clipdata/clipdata_bodytext_240524_131416_027.sdocx--></p>
<p>There's something known as "akash" aka "akashic records" is a popular term. Occultists say that the akash is the substance which creates the other 4 elements. (And these 4 elements&nbsp;<strong>are not</strong> the 4 states of matter gas, plasma, liquid, solid. <strong>No!</strong>) 4 elements mean various things but one of them is the process of occurrences in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air = movability, ability for an event to happen.</li>
<li>Fire = desire, (strong desire is crucial in prayers to work, and people often lack true desire, according to occultists).</li>
<li>Water = beginning of solidification, condensation, this the stage when events occur, the acts are being done. However, it is incomplete and a crucial step is to keep the results. Therefore...</li>
<li>Earth = hardening. As hard as diamonds (that's why in tarot diamonds represent earth. They're the lowest of the 4). Once we reach our goal, we often forget to make sure it persists...</li>
</ul>
<p>That's some tarot stuff I just ended up including here. If you got proof remote viewing works, do you automatically believe tarot works? Tarot is one of the things Christians hate the most. Because it clearly works. And it works just like remote viewing, through our intentions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see, I drifted off when talking about akash. Akash is what makes these elements up. In other words, substance of existence stores memory of all of what ever happened, and simulated versions of all possible futures.&nbsp;</p>
